List three questions that you had to answer in the process of writing these two functions--specifically,
questions for which the answer determined the behavior of the functions.  Also, state the answers to
these three question

1. What language am I going to program this in?
 - I chose to use python, mainly because I've been learning web frameworks with it lately and I like it
   better than Java. The short syntax is another main selling point.

2. How do you calculate mean and mode?
 - I understand that I'm a senior in college, and I did know mean by heart, but I wanted to double check
   and be sure I was going to return the right values.

3. How am I going to make the functions calculate mean and mode? Am I going to code it myself or use
   a library?
 - Initially I wanted to do all of the programming myself, so that is why my get_mean() function was
   programmed by hand. I thought about how I could most easily count the items in the list for the
   get_mode() function and after looking up techniques I started looking for libraries instead. Eventually
   I found the built in python statistics package and chose that for my function. If I were releasing this
   code somewhere, I would certainly use the statistics package for both functions.
